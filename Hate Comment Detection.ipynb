Overview\nIn this notebook, I am going to build a Jigsaw Toxicity Classification Model using [DistilBERT](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/models/distil_bert/) from [KerasNLP Library](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp).\n\nDistilBERT is a distiled version of BERT which leverages Knowledge Distillation, it retrains 97% of language understanding capabilities of original BERT, while being 40% smaller and 60% faster.\n\nKerasNLP is a Library based on Keras that makes it easier to implement NLP appplication by writing only a few lines of code. As you can see below.\n```python\ndef get_model(config):\n    encoder = keras_nlp.models.DistilBertBackbone.from_preset(\n        \"distil_bert_base_en_uncased\"\n    )\n    encoder.trainable = False\n    preprocessor = keras_nlp.models.DistilBertPreprocessor.from_preset(\"distil_bert_base_en_uncased\")\n    inputs = keras.Input(shape=(), dtype=tf.string)\n    x = preprocessor(inputs)\n    x = encoder(x)\n    x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(x)\n    output = layers.Dense(6, activation=\"sigmoid\")(x)\n    model = keras.Model(inputs, output, name=\"model\")\n    model.compile(\n        \"adam\", loss=\"binary_crossentropy\", metrics=[\"categorical_accuracy\", keras.metrics.AUC()]\n    )\n    return model\n```","metadata":{"id":"3br121fsL3by","papermill":{"duration":0.050404,"end_time":"2021-11-17T03:42:41.441273","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-17T03:42:41.390869","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2.\"></a>\n## 2.

But we can predict how brick walls behave when they are hit by things. So this issue is not one of the things that is a matter of individual opinion.

The description of events on the page at the moment is physically impossible and refuted by all available evidence. 114 foot Airliners can\\'t fit in 27 foot holes! This is not \"\"my opinion\"\", this is a fact. Its also pretty comical that the current description is refuted even by the (shamefully inadequate) collection of images on the CNN link.

I hope that someone of serious Wikipedia administrators will read this report and take serious steps in protecting the Wikipedia dignity\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI do understand that Wikipedia is a free encyclopaedia - but still some kind of very basic ethicalrules shall be applicable and obliging to all editors.I noticed that you have a person whose nick name is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab and whose number of edits goes over 60 per day very often spanning 5-11 hours dayly. This person is extremely agressive and intolerant and his/her edits are causing a lot of damage and irritated many people.\\n\\nThe best way to describe his/her behaviour and \\'contributions\\' are given by a few people which can be summarised/quoted this way:\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Spylab&oldid;=65026476\\n\\n\\'I am probably from the USA and like to scrap others\\' contributions due to what I call \"\"factual correctness\"\" - instead of knowing the facts and reporting them!\\'\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab/User_talk:Spylab/archive3#What.27s_is_the_problem.3F.3F.3F\\n\\n\\'I\\'ve noticed that you are editing someone\\'s contribution by altering the text under pretext of grammar corrections - not reading references at all. Moreover, not reading the references nor providing your own - you are demanding new references.\\n\\nAlso, on January 12th you\\'ve made 65 edits on various articles in the span of more than 11 hours(merge, clean, copy, revert, etc). Don\\'t you think that it might be seen as something wrong with you if you are spending day after day, hours and hours - practically not contributing anything serious to Wikipedia, only irritating many people this way???\\'\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#About_Basic_Editorial_Ethics_Here\\n\\n\\'When seeing that the existing edition of the Croatia section here, was reduced by User:Spylab to just 6 sentences out of which four were marked by the [citation needed] tag . Moreover, User:Spylab \\'completed\\' his own \\'editorial\\' work by adding {unreferenced|date=November 2006} and {weasel} tags on the top of this page!!! How a serious editor could tag/mark his own edits this way??? I reverted the section demanding explanation for this almost complete section destruction. Ultimately, the existing edits cannot be re-written or destroyed by just throwing claim \\'replaced content with info from Neo-Nazism in Croatia because old version didn\\'t focus on neo-Nazism\\' as he did.\\n\\nAll my attempts to bring the editorial work on the same start and support any further editorial work with facts and serious observations - failed. Instead even willing to discuss the issue seriously, User:Spylab started throwing accusations \\'last edit brok 3RR rule\\', \\'you may be blocked\\' , \\'sock-puppetry\\' etc. and selfpraising (User:Spylab) work as superior and claiming that I do not know what Neo-Nazism is. My attempt (questions) to ask him why he deleted what he deleted already - are removed from the talk page and when I\\'ve put back the deleted questions - User:Spylab ignored them completely.\\n\\nI had impression that I have to deal with an extremely cheeky and primitive personality and wondered how this person could have any access to the editirial work here. Then, I went further and examined the whole User:Spylab editorial work and noticed that User:Spylab commited more than 500 changes within 10 days i.e. more than fifty edits per day - (November 28 - December 7 2006). In that period of time [User:Spylab] was busy by the Wikipedia editing on: November 29 - 9 hours, November 30 - 16 hours (63 edits!!!) , December 1 - 18 hours, December 2 - 7 hours, December 3 - 8 hours, December 4 - 21 hours, December 5 - 12 hours, December 6 - 17 hours, and December 7 - 8 hours.\\n\\nThe content of User:Spylab edits were - spelling check, version reverts, removal of links, copy-paste etc. So it is quite clearly that I had to deal with a mentally challenged person!!!\\n\\nI just wonder how it is possible that a serious publisher could allow such access to the articles to a person like User:Spylab.\\' As per his/her own words, as an Neo-Nazism in Croatia section editor, Spylab publicly claims\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Page_protection_sought\\n\\n\\'Actually, it\\'s not complicated at all. The revert war has nothing to do with point of view, and I am not an expert on Croatia at all.\\'\\n\\nMy note - how then this person should edit some subject (s)he is not familirar with?

There is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated natural/free convection when forced convection (the common type that happens in car radiators) works just as well as illustration. Choaygame is technically and perfectly correct that only internal energy (not heat) can be advected as a bulk flow of matter containing energy within it and moved from here to there. That means heat pumps don\\'t really pump heat but rather energy. Heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there, cannot even be defined! If you can\\'t put a number on it you can\\'t claim it\\'s \"\"real \"\".\\n\\nTemperature and thus kinetic energy may  play only minor roles in this, when energy of phase transitions is involved. For example water can be turned to steam and sent down a pipe to transfer energy by condensing somewhere else, and yet the temp changes are very small as small as you like for a given transfer. They are markets for direction of transfer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved. That\\'s a clue that they aren\\'t fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically. Physically it is potential energy being moved, not unlike moving a charged battery from here to there. It actually has nothing to do with \"\"heat\"\" in a thermodynamic sense. 18:46, 14\"',\n       b\"You are currently unable to edit pages on Wikipedia.\\nYou can still read pages, but you cannot edit, change, or create them. \\nEditing from 88.96.108.118 has been disabled by Dominic for the following reason(s):\\n\\n  CheckUser evidence has determined that this IP address (or network) has been used abusively. \\nThis address (or network) has been blocked temporarily or permanently to prevent further abuse.  \\n\\nIn extreme cases, an entire network may be blocked to prevent an abusive user from continually changing their IP address in order to evade blocks or abusing multiple accounts.

User  tried to add false traits-false claims and misleading citations with URLs that do not backup his statements, he misinterpretated current sources and i suspect by purpose (just check what the references www.Astrologyzone.com and www.artcharts.com really say about each sign and what this guy tried to write in there...). I have also notified administrator  about this but he seems busy.\\nNOTE:\\nThere was a similar activity in the Scorpio wikipage where administrator Black Kite decided to delete all trait areas from every related astrological sign page in wikipedia, maybe you can do the same in this article . Better delete every trait in that article if you have no other choice than lies exist in here.

Yeah, I know things about you, sonny. Like I said, you're in so much danger it ain't even funny. I'm gonna cut you. Your bully boy tactics have really fucked things up for you.

And I hope for your sake there aren't any copies of 'The York Quiz Book' still in circulation; because then I'll know your name, wont I?
