hate Comments Detection 


- Efficient Tech: I chose DistilBERT for its efficiency, retaining BERT's language understanding while being smaller and faster.

- Streamlined Development: Leveraging KerasNLP simplifies NLP application development and fine-tune the model to classify text comments into multiple categories, including "toxic," "severe_toxic," "obscene," "threat," "insult," and "identity_hate.".

- Main Objective: My primary goal is creating a model to automatically classify toxic comments in text data, promoting a safer online environment.

- Data Foundation: I use the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset for model training and evaluation.

- Efficiency Focus: The project prioritizes efficient toxic comment identification without compromising performance.

- Impact-Driven: I recognize the importance of addressing online toxicity and aim to contribute to a more respectful online community.
